# Depth-first Search

You're given a `Node` class that has a `name` and an array of optional `children` nodes. When put together, nodes form an acyclic tree-like structure.

Implement the `depthFirstSearch` method on the `Node` class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Depth-first Search approach (specifically navigating the tree from left to right), stores all of the nodes' names in the input array, and returns it.

If you're unfamiliar with Depth-first Search, we recommend watching the Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting to code.

**Sample Input**
```
graph =         A
             /  |  \
            B   C   D
          /   \    /  \
         E     F  G    H
              / \  \
             I   J  K
```

**Sample Output**
```
["A", "B", "E", "F", "I", "J", "C", "D", "G", "K", "H"]
```

**Hints**
<details>
    <summary>Hint 1</summary>

    The Depth-first Search algorithm works by traversing a graph branch by
    branch. In other words, before traversing any Node's sibling Nodes, its
    children nodes must be traversed. How can you simply and effectively keep
    track of Nodes' sibling Nodes as you traverse them, all the while retaining
    the order in which you must traverse them?

<details>
    <summary>Hint 2</summary>

    Start at the root Node and try simply calling the depthFirstSearch method on
    all of its children Nodes. Then, call the depthFirstSearch method on all
    children Nodes of each child node. Keep applying this logic until the entire
    graph has been traversed. Don't forget to add the current Node's name to the
    input array at every call of depthFirstSearch.

**Complexities**

    <summary>Optimal Sapce & Time Complexity</summary>

    O(v + e) time | O(v) space - where v is the number of vertices of the input
    graph and e is the number of edges of the input graph
